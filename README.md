# EPG (Electronic Program Guide) for Icelandic Television

This application fetches and serves an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) for Icelandic TV channels. It queries the Redbee **Exposure** API, converts the response to XMLTVâ€‘compatible format, saves the XML to disk every hour at **XX:45 UTC**, and exposes it via a lightweight HTTP endpoint with millisecond latency.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s new in v1.1

* **Background refresh with APScheduler** â€“ the EPG is regenerated hourly at `:45` and written to `epg.xml`.
* **Instant responses** â€“ the `/epg` route now serves the cached file instead of generating onâ€‘request.
* **Shared volume** â€“ the XML file is stored in `/data/epg.xml` so it survives container restarts.
* **Productionâ€‘ready Gunicorn launch** with `--preload` and a single worker.

---

## Features

* Hourly automatic fetch of EPG data
* Converts data to XMLTV schema
* Single HTTP endpoint (`/epg`) that returns XML instantly
* Structured logging to `/app/logs`
* Lightweight singleâ€‘container deployment (Flask + scheduler)
